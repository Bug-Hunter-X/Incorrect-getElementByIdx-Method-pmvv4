# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect getElementByIdx Method

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where an incorrect method is used to access an element by its ID.  The code attempts to use `getElementByIdx` instead of the correct `getElementById`. This results in the element not being manipulated, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected version.
